# gridsampler

A common approach in the evaluation of multiple repertory grids is to categorize the constructs into themes. Sometimes the question arises what sample size would be needed in order to achieve a minimum saturation of a certain number of constructs per category. The gridsampler GUI allows to run simulations in order to answer this question. 

    # to run the GUI type
    library(gridsampler)
    sampler()
