# gridsampler

A common approach in the evaluation of multiple repertory grids is to categorize the constructs into themes (e.g. Jankowicz, 2004). Sometimes the question arises what sample size would be needed in order to achieve a minimum saturation of a certain number of constructs per category. The gridsampler GUI allows to run simulations in order to answer this question.

    # development version from github use the devtools package.
    # You may also download the binaries from the downloads page.

    install_github("gridsampler", "markheckmann") 
        
    # to run the gridsampler GUI type
    library(gridsampler)
    sampler()
