# gridsampler

A common approach in the evaluation of multiple repertory grids is to sort the constructs into categories (e.g. Jankowicz, 2004). Sometimes the question arises what sample size would be needed in order to achieve a minimum saturation of a certain number of constructs per category. The gridsampler GUI allows to run simulations in order to answer these type of questions.
 
You can install the software from [github](https://github.com/markheckmann/gridsampler).

    library(devtools)
    install_github("gridsampler/markheckmann") 

An introduction to its usage can be found on [github pages](http://markheckmann.github.io/gridsampler/). Please report any bugs [here](https://github.com/markheckmann/gridsampler/issues).
